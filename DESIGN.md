# UP42 Senior Cloud Engineer Challenge - Design Decisions & Trade-offs

## üéØ **Challenge Overview**

This document articulates my thought process, design decisions, trade-offs, and considerations for implementing a production-ready deployment of the s3www application with MinIO dependency using Helm and Terraform.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Design Decisions**

### **1. Infrastructure Architecture**

**Decision**: Use AWS EKS with Terraform for infrastructure management
- **Rationale**: EKS provides managed Kubernetes control plane, reducing operational overhead
- **Trade-off**: Higher cost vs self-managed Kubernetes, but better for production reliability
- **Alternative Considered**: Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 - rejected due to operational complexity

**Decision**: Multi-AZ deployment with public/private subnets
- **Rationale**: High availability and security best practices
- **Trade-off**: Higher cost vs single-AZ, but essential for production
- **Alternative Considered**: Single-AZ deployment - rejected for production readiness

### **2. Application Deployment Strategy**

**Decision**: Separate Terraform modules for infrastructure and applications
- **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, easier maintenance
- **Trade-off**: More complex than single Terraform configuration
- **Alternative Considered**: All-in-one Terraform - rejected for maintainability

**Decision**: Use Helm for application packaging, Terraform for orchestration
- **Rationale**: Helm provides templating and versioning, Terraform provides infrastructure
- **Trade-off**: Two tools to manage vs single tool
- **Alternative Considered**: Pure Terraform with kubectl_manifest - rejected for Helm's templating benefits

### **3. Storage Strategy**

**Decision**: Use MinIO for S3-compatible storage instead of AWS S3
- **Rationale**: Challenge requirement specifies MinIO as dependency
- **Trade-off**: Additional complexity vs direct AWS S3 usage
- **Alternative Considered**: AWS S3 - rejected due to challenge requirements

**Decision**: EBS CSI Driver for persistent storage
- **Rationale**: Native AWS storage integration, automatic provisioning
- **Trade-off**: AWS lock-in vs portable storage solution
- **Alternative Considered**: Local storage - rejected for data persistence

## üîí **Security Considerations**

### **1. Credential Management**

**Decision**: Environment-specific credential strategies
- **Development**: Hardcoded credentials for simplicity
- **Production**: AWS Secrets Manager with External Secrets Operator
- **Rationale**: Balance between development ease and production security
- **Trade-off**: Different approaches per environment vs consistent approach

**Security Concerns**:
- Hardcoded credentials in development (mitigated by non-production use)
- Secrets Manager costs in production
- External Secrets Operator complexity

### **2. Network Security**

**Decision**: Private subnets for application pods, public subnets for load balancers
- **Rationale**: Defense in depth, minimal attack surface
- **Trade-off**: More complex networking vs simple public deployment

**Security Concerns**:
- NAT Gateway costs
- Potential network bottlenecks
- Complexity of troubleshooting

### **3. Pod Security**

**Decision**: Production-grade security contexts for production environment
- **Rationale**: Follow Kubernetes security best practices
- **Trade-off**: Potential compatibility issues vs enhanced security

**Security Concerns**:
- Application compatibility with security contexts
- Potential permission issues
- Debugging complexity

## üìä **Monitoring & Observability**

### **1. Metrics Collection**

**Decision**: Prometheus annotations for automatic discovery
- **Rationale**: Future-proof for Prometheus Operator integration
- **Trade-off**: Additional configuration vs manual setup

**Concerns**:
- Prometheus Operator not yet deployed
- Metrics endpoint availability
- Resource overhead

### **2. Logging Strategy**

**Decision**: Rely on Kubernetes native logging
- **Rationale**: Simplicity for initial deployment
- **Trade-off**: Limited log aggregation vs complex logging infrastructure

**Concerns**:
- No centralized logging
- Limited log retention
- Debugging challenges

## üöÄ **Scalability Considerations**

### **1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**

**Decision**: Disabled by default, enabled in production
- **Rationale**: Cost optimization for development, performance for production
- **Trade-off**: Manual scaling vs automatic scaling

**Concerns**:
- Resource waste in development
- Potential scaling delays in production
- Cost implications

### **2. Node Scaling**

**Decision**: Auto-scaling node groups with cost optimization
- **Rationale**: Balance between availability and cost
- **Trade-off**: Scaling delays vs cost savings

**Concerns**:
- Pod scheduling delays during scale-up
- Potential pod evictions during scale-down
- Cold start performance

## üí∞ **Cost Optimization**

### **1. Instance Types**

**Decision**: t3.medium for better pod capacity
- **Rationale**: Balance between cost and performance
- **Trade-off**: Higher cost vs t3.small, but prevents pod limit issues

**Cost Concerns**:
- ~$30/month per node vs ~$15/month for t3.small
- NAT Gateway costs (~$45/month)
- EBS storage costs

### **2. Scaling Strategy**

**Decision**: Scale to zero capability for development
- **Rationale**: Significant cost savings when not in use
- **Trade-off**: Cold start delays vs cost savings

**Cost Concerns**:
- EKS control plane costs (~$73/month)
- S3 state storage costs
- Potential data transfer costs

## üîÑ **Operational Considerations**

### **1. Deployment Strategy**

**Decision**: Rolling updates with health checks
- **Rationale**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Trade-off**: More complex vs simple recreate strategy

**Operational Concerns**:
- Health check configuration
- Rollback complexity
- Resource requirements during updates

### **2. Backup Strategy**

**Decision**: Velero for Kubernetes backup
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive backup solution
- **Trade-off**: Additional complexity vs simple storage backup

**Operational Concerns**:
- Backup storage costs
- Recovery time objectives
- Backup verification complexity

### **3. Disaster Recovery**

**Decision**: Multi-AZ deployment with backup
- **Rationale**: High availability and data protection
- **Trade-off**: Higher costs vs single-AZ deployment

**Operational Concerns**:
- Recovery time objectives
- Data consistency
- Testing complexity

## üö® **Known Limitations & Concerns**

### **1. Missing Requirements**

**Gap**: No mechanism to automatically fetch "File to serve"
- **Impact**: Manual file upload required
- **Mitigation**: Could add init container or job for automatic file fetching

**Gap**: Helm chart doesn't manage both applications together
- **Impact**: Separate deployment processes
- **Mitigation**: Could create parent Helm chart with subcharts

### **2. Security Limitations**

**Concern**: Development credentials in plain text
- **Impact**: Security risk if accidentally deployed to production
- **Mitigation**: Environment-specific configurations

**Concern**: No network policies
- **Impact**: Pod-to-pod communication not restricted
- **Mitigation**: Could add Calico or similar network policy solution

### **3. Operational Limitations**

**Concern**: No centralized logging
- **Impact**: Limited observability
- **Mitigation**: Could add Fluentd/Fluent Bit

**Concern**: No alerting
- **Impact**: No proactive monitoring
- **Mitigation**: Could add AlertManager configuration
